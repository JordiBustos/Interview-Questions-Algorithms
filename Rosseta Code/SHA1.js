/*
SHA-1 or SHA1 is a one-way hash function; it computes a 160-bit message digest.

SHA-1 often appears in security protocols; for example, many HTTPS websites use RSA with SHA-1 to secure their connections.

BitTorrent uses SHA-1 to verify downloads.

Git and Mercurial use SHA-1 digests to identify commits.

A US government standard, FIPS 180-1, defines SHA-1.

Write a function that returns the SHA-1 message digest for a given string.
